## Strategies for Enhancing 3-Person Team Collaboration within a Larger Scrum Framework

To improve collaboration and a sense of "team combat" for a 3-person sub-team operating within a larger 20-person Scrum development team, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Collaborative Jira Ticket Management (Jira Ticket 的協同管理)
- **Joint Planning and Breakdown:**
    - After Sprint Planning or when a large user story/task is assigned to the small team, collectively discuss and break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
    - Assign these sub-tasks within the small team.
- **Handling Externally Assigned Tickets:**
    - When a ticket is assigned directly to an individual by a PM, team lead, or client, the assignee should:
        - Promptly share the ticket with the small team (e.g., in a quick huddle or via the team chat).
        - Facilitate a brief discussion to ensure shared understanding, identify potential collaboration points, or break it down further if needed.
        - Ensure the small team's specific Jira label/component is applied for visibility.
- **Use of Labels/Components:**
    - Create a unique Jira label (e.g., `team-uds`) or a specific component for your small team's tasks.
    - This allows for easy filtering and tracking of the small team's overall progress and workload.
- **Informal Ticket Reviews:**
    - Before creating complex or critical tickets, have a quick sync-up within the small team to ensure clarity, consistency in requirements, and to avoid duplication.
- **Cross-linking and Watching:**
    - For tickets with dependencies within the small team, ensure they are linked.
    - Encourage team members to "watch" relevant tickets of other small team members to stay informed.
- **Benefit:** Creates a shared understanding of the work, improves visibility into each other's tasks, and fosters a more unified approach to tackling sprint goals.

### 2. Reinforcing Small Team Goals (強化小組目標感)
- **Sub-Team Sprint Goals:**
    - In addition to the overall Sprint Goal of the larger team, define 1-2 specific, achievable goals for the 3-person team within the sprint.
    - These goals should contribute to the main Sprint Goal but provide a more focused objective for the small team.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:**
    - Acknowledge and celebrate when the small team achieves its specific goals.
- **Benefit:** Provides a shared sense of purpose and accomplishment, boosting morale and team cohesion.

### General Principles for the Small Team:
- **Proactive Communication:** Encourage open and frequent updates, even if informal.
- **Shared Responsibility:** Foster a sense that everyone is responsible for the small team's success.
- **Regular Mini-Retrospectives:** Periodically (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly for 15-30 minutes), the small team can reflect on what’s working well in their collaboration and what could be improved.
